09 Jan- Changing the CSS Library from Bootstrap to Semantic in the previous version of MonsterBase proved WAY beyond my ability, so I am starting with a new CRA app and rebuilding the React components using Semantic UI.

To anyone curious as to why I would want to do that: the elements in the Semantic UI are much more "polished," design-wise, and using Semantic will give me a much better-looking result with far less work than Bootstrap would (at least at my current skill level.) 

So then, right now I need to:
1. Rebuild the existing React components using Semantic
2. Copy all the server-side stuff into the main directory.
