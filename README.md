09 Jan- Changing the CSS Library from Bootstrap to Semantic in the previous version of MonsterBase proved WAY beyond my ability, so I am starting with a new CRA app and rebuilding the React components using Semantic UI.

To anyone curious as to why I would want to do that: the elements in the Semantic UI are much more "polished" design-wise than what is easily available in Bootstrap. Using Semantic will give me a much better-looking result with far less work than Bootstrap would (at least at my current skill level.) 

So then, right now I need to:
1. Rebuild the existing React components using Semantic
2. Copy all the server-side stuff into the main directory.

10 Jan - All the basic blocks are in place.  Getting ready to start shfting to Semantic.

11 Jan - Moved some components to Semantic.

12 Jan - Everything seems to be going smoothly. Building out React components for the front end.

13 Feb - After a month of coding sidequests and non-coding stuff, I am back on this and adding back-end and databse functionality.
